# SoCon
Software Engineering Project - SE subject from the UC.

Description
----------------------
The aim of this project was to recreate all the steps necessary to develop a successful Software from an Software Engineer's Perspective. The "Theme" of this Project was to create a Message Management App, similar to IRC but with some more functions. The user can create private and public rooms, add friends, create themes, change the room's permissions, join other's people rooms, send private messages, display advertisement messages in his own rooms or in the rooms that he also moderates, participate in the room's discussions, etc...  

 - Software Engineering Steps
    - First, we have started by analysing the specifications of the project such as the requirements needed for the actual project and the respective Use Cases Diagram;
    - Secondly, we have created the Classes Diagram and the User interface prototypes;
    - After that, we had to make sure that we covered all angles so we have created the Sequences Diagram, made a vertical prototype as well as some JUnit tests;
    - Finally, we have created and updated all the UML Diagrams (Use Cases, Classes, Sequences, Activities and State Diagrams) as well as have developed the final version of the App and the resulting JUnit tests, that were needed to make sure everything worked...
